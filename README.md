# h2cgan
We provide a simple GAN based baseline for image deraining, dehazing tasks. Some result images are uploaded in the image folder. Processing of cityscape images using H2CGAN and other SOA techniques are provided







Visualizing feature activations 

# Euclidean distance--->sample data in test folder

1.To calculate Euclidean distance add the path of the .pt files.
2. It will give distance values in .txt file.
3. Pass the .txt file in graph code to plot a Euclidean graph.


#To plot the Activation sum plot RIS-original, RIS-DID and RIS-DRRID ---> sample data in test1 folder

1. Add the path of .pt files for all the three datasets.
2. Generate .csv files denotive sum of all the values>0.5 and values<0.5.
3. pass these .csv to generate the graph.
